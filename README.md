# moneymoney-deutschlandcard

This is an extension for the MoneyMoney Mac app (https://moneymoney-app.com/). It allows to fetch the total number of points and the transactions of the last year for a DeutschlandCard account. Authentication is supported via card number and password (but not via card number, birth date, and zip code).

# Update 2020-03-07:
DeutschlandCard now uses reCAPTCHA for the REST API. The authentication via the Money Money extension isn't possible anymore, unfortunately.
